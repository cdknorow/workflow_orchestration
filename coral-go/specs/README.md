## Writing a New Spec

1. Create a new directory: `specs/YOUR_FEATURE/`
2. Add a `README.md` following the structure of existing specs:
   - **Overview** — What and why
   - **Problem** — What's broken or missing
   - **Design** — Data model, API, UI
   - **Implementation Plan** — Phased with file paths
3. Update this index with the new spec
