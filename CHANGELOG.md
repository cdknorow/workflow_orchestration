# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 3.0.0 — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Hooks via `--settings` temp file** — No longer modifies user's `settings.local.json`; reads and deep-merges the full settings hierarchy (global → project → local), appends Coral hooks, writes to `/tmp/coral_settings_<id>.json`
- **System prompt in settings file** — PROTOCOL.md and per-agent persona consolidated into `systemPrompt` field in the temp settings file, removing `--append-system-prompt` flag
- **Sidebar kebab menu** — Per-agent dropdown with Attach, Restart, Rename, Session Info, and Kill Session actions
- **Collapsible agent groups** — Click group headers to collapse/expand, persisted in localStorage
- **Group-level Kill All** — Kill all agents in a group from the group header kebab menu
- **Agent group cards** — Agents on the same message board are grouped into bordered cards with auto-generated accent color and board link icon
- **Terminal session icon** — Terminal sessions show a `>_` icon instead of generic "Agent" label
- **Drag-to-reorder agents** in sidebar with persistent ordering
- **Message board operator controls** — Pause agent reads and delete messages from the board UI
- **Terminal input polish** — Disconnect indicator, input queue, and WebSocket resize support

### Fixed
- Diff view line numbers overlapping code text (diff2html position fix)
- Sidebar hover jitter eliminated (opacity transitions instead of display toggle)
- Tooltip no longer covers sidebar kebab menu (z-index fix)
- SSRF protection hardened per security review
- Critical and high severity security audit findings addressed

### Removed
- `install_hooks()` function that wrote hooks into user's `settings.local.json`
- Dead `install_hooks()` call sites in web_server.py, session_manager.py, and base.py
- Stale coral-hook/corral-hook entries cleaned from all settings files

## 2.5.0 — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Batch board unread counts** — New `get_all_unread_counts()` method replaces N+1 per-agent `check_unread()` queries with a single DB pass
- **Log status mtime cache** — `get_log_status()` skips re-parsing when log file hasn't changed, eliminating up to 4MB of file I/O per agent per poll cycle
- **WebSocket diff updates** — Dashboard sends only changed/removed sessions instead of the full array (~80% payload reduction with 10 agents)
- **DB indexes** — Added indexes on `agent_events(session_id, event_type)` and `git_snapshots(session_id, recorded_at DESC)` for faster queries
- **Performance test suite** — 23 new tests covering critical performance paths (git store, log snapshots, board queries, pulse detector, idle detector)
- **Test DB isolation** — `conftest.py` with per-test temp database directories to prevent SQLite lock contention across concurrent test runs
- **Toolbar WebSocket input** — `sendRawKeys()` now sends through WebSocket instead of POST requests, with POST fallback

### Changed
- **CoralStore simplified** — Replaced 80+ manual delegation methods with `__getattr__` dynamic dispatch (414→81 lines)
- **Shared helpers extracted** — `_build_session_list()`, `_resolve_workdir()`, `get_diff_base()` deduplicated across endpoints (~130 lines removed)
- **Migration blocks consolidated** — 12 separate `ALTER TABLE` try/except blocks replaced with data-driven loop
- **Idle detector optimized** — Uses `Path.stat()` instead of reading 200 log lines per agent every 60s

### Fixed
- **Message board cursor bug** — Read cursor no longer advances past unseen messages from other agents
- **"Unknown" author names** — Board subscriber records now use tmux session names matching message post IDs
- **Consolidated CoralStore instances** — `restart_session()` uses single store instead of creating 3 separate ones

## 2.4.1 — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Redesigned agent team selection flow** — Default team now includes 3 agents (Lead Developer, QA Engineer, Orchestrator) with compact card UI, edit/collapse toggle, and preset picker with 8 predefined roles
- **Terminal scrollback setting** — Configurable scrollback buffer (1k–100k lines) in user settings, applies to existing terminals on save
- **Remote Server field** in the new agent launch modal for cross-server board support

### Fixed
- **xterm.js scrollbar now clickable** — Use CSS `clip-path` on `.xterm-screen` to expose the native scrollbar without breaking terminal rendering
- **Wider xterm scrollbar** — Increased from 6px to 12px with hover highlight for easier interaction
- **Session resume** now restores prompt and board subscription correctly

## 2.4.0 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Cross-server message board** — Agents on different Coral instances can join each other's boards with local polling for tmux notifications (NAT/firewall-friendly)
- **Remote board proxy endpoints** — Local Coral forwards board API calls to remote servers so the dashboard can display remote board data
- **Remote board CLI registration** — `coral-board --server <url> join` auto-registers with local Coral for background notification polling
- **Coral-managed URL routing** — Board server URL written to agent state file on launch, agents use plain `coral-board` commands without `--server` flag
- **`origin_server` subscriber field** — Remote subscribers tagged on the board, local notifier skips them (remote poller handles notifications instead)
- **Tray app `--home` flag** — Override the working directory for the tray app

### Fixed
- **message_check.py hook** — Use `server_url` from board state file instead of hardcoded localhost, fixing unread notifications for remote boards

## 2.3.1 — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Unified icon set across all surfaces — monochrome coral silhouette used for system tray, favicon, top bar, welcome screen, and diff viewer

## 2.3.0 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- Monochrome template icon for macOS menu bar — renders white on dark, black on light
- Update notifications in tray app — checks PyPI on launch, shows macOS notification
- "Check for Updates" menu item for on-demand version checks
- Homebrew Cask (`Casks/coral.rb`) for `brew install --cask coral` with DMG download

## 2.2.1 — 2026-03-15

- Clarify tray menu labels: "Shutdown — Kill Agents & Stop Server", "Quit — Exit Coral"

## 2.2.0 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Inter-agent message board** — Agents communicate via shared project boards with per-subscriber read cursors, @mentions (`@notify-all`, `@<session_id>`, `@<job_title>`), and auto-pruning
- **Agent Teams** — Launch multiple agents on a shared board with per-agent roles and behavior prompts from the `+New` modal
- **coral-board CLI** — Terminal interface for agents to join boards, post messages, read updates, and list subscribers
- **Message board background notifier** — Nudges idle agents with unread messages every 30 seconds via tmux
- **Board hover cards** — Live session tooltips show board subscription and unread message count
- **macOS system tray app** (`coral-tray`) — Runs Coral as a menu bar icon with Open Dashboard, Shutdown, and Quit actions. Launches as a background process so the terminal is freed immediately
- **macOS .app installer** — py2app build pipeline produces `Coral.app` and `Coral.dmg` for drag-to-Applications install
- **GitHub Actions macOS build** — Automatically builds and attaches `Coral.dmg` to GitHub Releases
- **Session prompt persistence** — Prompt and board_name stored in live_sessions DB; restored on session restart

### Fixed

## 0.6.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix session cycling when multiple agents share the same directory** — Terminal WebSocket connections no longer cycle between sessions that share a working directory (e.g. two agents both in `worktree_2`). Added a generation counter to suppress stale `onclose` reconnect handlers, and a guard to skip reconnecting if already connected to the same session.
- **Fix WebSocket coral handler overwriting session_id on name match** — When a session restarts and multiple sessions share the same directory name, the dashboard no longer accidentally switches to the wrong session via the name-based fallback.
- **Fix git snapshots collision for same-directory sessions** — Changed the `git_snapshots` UNIQUE constraint from `(agent_name, commit_hash)` to `(session_id, commit_hash)` so each session tracks its own git history. Includes an automatic DB migration for existing databases.
- **Fix git poller skipping second session in shared directory** — The git poller now stores snapshots for all sessions in a directory, not just the first one discovered.
- **Fix git state lookups to use session_id** — Live session API and WebSocket now look up git state by `session_id` first, falling back to `agent_name` for backwards compatibility.
- **Fix frontend task/note creation missing session_id** — Tasks and notes created from the dashboard now include `session_id` in the request body, ensuring data is properly scoped per session.
