# Live Sessions

Live Sessions is the core real-time monitoring and control interface for Coral. It lets you observe and interact with AI coding agents (Claude and Gemini) as they work in parallel git worktrees — all from a single browser tab.

Each live session represents one agent running in a tmux session. The dashboard provides a browser-based view of the agent's terminal output, activity timeline, tasks, notes, and conversation history, all updating in real time.

---

## Getting started

### Start the dashboard

```bash
# Dashboard only
coral

# Dashboard + agents for all worktrees in current directory
launch-coral
```

Open `http://localhost:8420` in your browser. The sidebar shows **Live Sessions** at the top with any running agents grouped by worktree name.

### Launch a new session

Click the **+ New** button in the Live Sessions sidebar header. The launch modal offers three types:

#### AI Agent

Launch a single agent with an optional initial prompt and message board subscription.

1. Fill in the fields:
    - **Agent Name** (optional) — A display name like "Auth Feature"
    - **Working Directory** — The git repo path (click **Browse** to navigate)
    - **Agent Type** — Claude or Gemini
    - **Flags** (optional) — CLI flags like `--verbose`. Use the shortcut buttons for `--chrome` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
    - **Prompt** (optional) — An initial instruction to send to the agent on launch
2. Click **Launch**.

#### Agent Team

Launch multiple agents on a shared message board with per-agent roles and behavior prompts. See [Agent Teams & Message Board](agent-teams-message-board.md) for the full guide.

#### Terminal

Launch a plain shell session in a tmux pane — useful for running manual commands alongside your agents.

The new session appears in the sidebar. Click it to select.

!!! tip
    You can also launch agents from the command line with `launch-coral <path-to-worktrees>`, which discovers subdirectories and creates one agent per worktree automatically.

## Session view

When you select a live session, the main panel shows three areas: the **session header**, the **terminal area**, and the **command pane**.

### Session header

The header displays:

- **Status dot** — Color-coded: green (active), yellow (waiting for input), gray (stale)
- **Agent type badge** — `CLAUDE` or `GEMINI` with distinct styling
- **Session name** — Display name or worktree folder name
- **Branch** — Current git branch with a copy-to-clipboard button
- **Goal** — High-level objective parsed from `||PULSE:SUMMARY||` markers
- **Status** — Current task parsed from `||PULSE:STATUS||` markers

The header also contains action buttons:

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Info** | View session metadata (tmux session name, attach command, working directory, log path, branch, latest commit) |
| **Attach** | Open a native terminal window attached to the agent's tmux session |
| **Restart** | Restart the agent in the same working directory (optionally add new flags) |
| **Kill** | Terminate the tmux session and stop the agent |

### Waiting for input banner

When the agent needs a response, a yellow banner appears above the terminal:

> ⏳ Agent is waiting for input

The sidebar also shows a **NEEDS INPUT** badge on that session.

### Terminal area

The terminal area shows the agent's live output. Two rendering modes are available:

- **xterm.js** — Full terminal emulation with colors and formatting (default for Claude)
- **Semantic blocks** — Parsed output blocks (default for Gemini)

You can change the default renderer per agent type in **Settings** (gear icon, top right).

!!! info
    When you select text in the terminal, updates pause automatically to prevent the selection from being lost. A "Updates paused — text selected" badge appears until you deselect.

### Command pane

The command pane at the bottom has a resizable toolbar and a text input area.

**Toolbar buttons (left to right):**

| Section | Buttons | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Mode toggles | Plan Mode, Accept Edits, Bash Mode | Toggle Claude Code modes via Shift+Tab |
| Macros | `/compact`, `/clear`, custom macros | Send common commands with one click |
| Add macro | **+** | Create a custom macro button with a label and command |
| Navigation | **Esc**, **↑**, **↓**, **↵**, **Send** | Send navigation keys or submit the typed command |

Type any command in the textarea and click **Send** (or press Enter) to send it to the agent.

!!! tip
    Your input text is preserved per-session — switch between sessions without losing what you were typing.

---

## Side panel

The right-side panel has four tabs: **Activity**, **Tasks**, **Notes**, and **History**. The panel is resizable by dragging its left edge.

### Activity

The Activity tab shows a real-time event timeline of everything the agent is doing. Each event has an icon, description, and timestamp.

Event types include:

- **Read**, **Write**, **Edit** — File operations
- **Bash** — Shell commands
- **Grep**, **Glob** — Search operations
- **Web** — Web fetches
- **Tasks**, **Subagents** — Task and sub-agent activity
- **Status**, **Goal**, **Confidence** — PULSE protocol events
- **Stop/Notify** — Agent pause events

Use the **Filter** dropdown to toggle event categories on or off. An **activity chart** at the bottom shows the event distribution over time.

### Tasks

Create and manage task checklists for each session. Tasks are drag-reorderable and persist across Coral restarts.

- Click to add a new task
- Check the box to mark complete
- Drag to reorder

### Notes

Write markdown notes about each session. Click the notes area to edit, and the content renders as formatted markdown when you click away.

### History

The History tab shows the live JSONL conversation log — the full chat transcript between you and the agent. It displays:

- **User messages** — Your prompts and commands
- **Assistant messages** — Agent responses
- **Tool cards** — Expandable cards for Bash commands, Edit diffs, Read file contents, and other tool uses

The transcript polls for updates every second while the tab is active.

## Session management

### Renaming a session

Right-click a session in the sidebar to open the context menu and set a custom display name.

### Restarting a session

Click **Restart** in the session header. A modal appears where you can optionally add new CLI flags. The agent restarts in the same working directory with a new session UUID.

### Resuming a historical session

You can pick up where a previous session left off:

1. Find the completed session in the **History** section of the sidebar.
2. Click the **Resume** button in the historical session's header.
3. The Resume modal shows a list of currently live agents. Select which agent should continue the session.
4. Coral restarts the selected agent with `--resume`, loading the full conversation context from the previous session.

!!! warning
    Resume is supported for **Claude agents only**. Gemini does not support session resume.

!!! info
    If Coral restarts, resumed sessions are automatically re-resumed via `resume_persistent_sessions()`. The resume linkage is stored in the database.

## Session info modal

Click **Info** to view full session metadata:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Agent Name | Display name of the session |
| Agent Type | `claude` or `gemini` |
| Tmux Session | Full tmux session name (e.g., `claude-<uuid>`) |
| Attach Command | `tmux attach -t <session>` with a Copy button |
| Working Directory | Filesystem path for the agent's repo |
| Log Path | Path to the agent's log file |
| Pane Title | tmux pane title |
| Branch | Current git branch |
| Latest Commit | Most recent commit hash and message |
| Prompt | The initial prompt sent to the agent (if any) |
| Message Board | Clickable link to the agent's message board (if subscribed) |

---

## How it works

- Each session maps to one tmux session running one agent in one working directory
- Sessions are identified by UUIDs (tmux session name: `{agent_type}-{uuid}`)
- The dashboard auto-discovers sessions by querying tmux for panes matching the UUID naming convention
- WebSocket `/ws/coral` provides coral-wide session list updates every 3 seconds
- WebSocket `/ws/terminal/{name}` streams raw terminal content at 0.5-second intervals
- Sessions persist across Coral restarts — the `live_sessions` database table tracks registered sessions and relaunches them on startup
- Session prompts and board subscriptions are persisted, so agents are re-sent their prompt and re-subscribed to their board on restart
